In this repo I am rebuilding famous machine learning algorithms from scratch in order to have more consise understanding of how the algorithm works, learns and optimizes

Following are the algorithms:

1. [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/fadilparves/ML-MODEL-F-SCRATCH/tree/master/logistic_regression)
2. [Linear Regression Including MultiLinear support](https://github.com/fadilparves/ML-MODEL-F-SCRATCH/tree/master/linear_regression)
3. [Decision Tree](https://github.com/fadilparves/ML-MODEL-F-SCRATCH/tree/master/decision_tree_regressor)
4. [KMeans](https://github.com/fadilparves/ML-MODEL-F-SCRATCH/tree/master/kmeans)
5. Naive Bayes text classification
6. Stochastic Gradient Descent
7. Neural Networks (ANN)
8. Q-learning Reinforecement Learning

Once I am done with all algortihms, I will use these algorithms to solve real world problem and update it here, stay tuned guys.
